            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Dima. I am from Belarus, but I have been living in Poland for five years.
                 I became interested in programming during the coronavirus pandemic when I had more time and a desire to try something new.
                  I started by creating simple web pages. At first, it was difficult, but I persisted. Once I understood HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I decided to try finding a job.
                   My first company was Imado, which specializes in creating web pages using WordPress. There, I improved my knowledge and understanding of programming.
                    We built websites using ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) and various plugins like Contact Form 7 and Gravity Forms. I also learned how to work with servers and use GitHub.
                     Additionally, I gained experience in testing web pages. 
            </p>
            <p>As for my soft skills, I have a passion for learning foreign languages.
                 I speak Russian, Polish, English, and am currently learning German. I also have several years of experience as a tutor of Polish for foreigners.
                  I enjoy communicating with people.
            </p>

                <p>I used SCSS in this project and structured it with Gulp. The focus was on developing my front-end skills. The design was taken from the internet.</p>
